- 👋 Hi, I’m @bhawken
- 👀 I’m interested in ... anthropology, art, the history of science, and keeping track of my 4 kids.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the shortcut keys on a Mac, the present/future needs of GitHub users, and how to talk to our next # million users.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything you're working on that will inspire, excite, educate, and connect with our community.
- 📫 How to reach me ... slack, text, e-mail, "phone calls," secret handshakes.
